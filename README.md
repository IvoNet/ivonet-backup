# Remote backup system

The code in this project belongs to my remote backup system.

## What

In this article it is further explained TODO

## Usage

I've made these scripts Open Source but they are completely
tailor made for my situation.

Public private keys are needed and my "Click-On-Click-Off" system.

## volumes.txt

Create this file in the config folder and put a fully qualified path of a folder you want to backup per line

e.g.

volumes.txt:

```text
/volume1/important/data
/volume1/photos/2018
```

This file will not be created by default
